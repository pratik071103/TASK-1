# TASK-1
The process of cleaning the data set obtained from Kaggle's Cafe Sales was quite meticulous.
Initially, missing values were identified and dealt with promptly. Duplicates, errors, and 
unwanted values were diligently renamed to ensure data integrity. Any discrepancies were 
rectified by assigning these entries as blanks. To eliminate any potential data gaps, 
a specialized filter was applied, replacing all blanks with a universal placeholder, N/A.

Furthermore, to refine the dataset further, the average values replaced any inconsistencies 
in unit price and quantity entries. This standardization enhanced the dataset's accuracy and 
coherence substantially. Subsequently, the total price values were re-computed to reflect 
these adjustments accurately, ensuring the data's financial precision. 

In addition to these critical modifications, adjustments were made to the headers for 
consistency and clarity. By standardizing the headers, the data became more user-friendly
and comprehensible, reducing ambiguity for future analysis. Further refinements were made 
by correcting and aligning the various data types within the dataset. This meticulous 
process of fixing the data types using Power Query ensured uniformity across the information, 
streamlining any potential discrepancies in analysis.
